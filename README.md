## Getting Starting

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The easiest way to test it is to download all files and to make them run on your local web server.


### 1-Objectives

The purpose of this project is to create a complete application to access a dataset that we have chosen. We will therefore create a web application based on the AngularJS framework inspired by applications seen in courses. Your web client will need to use the framework's capabilities, present custom styles and designs, and be usable on phone and tablet. 📱:computer:

Criteria: ✅

* Use of AngularJS
* Style & Design
* Responsiveness

### 2-Schema

Your application should use external data (at least one) retrieved from one or more webservice (s). The JSON format is preferred, the goal is to create an application highlighting these data by displaying them on a site with a specific theme. Your application should also contain a custom filter.

Must use :
* ng-model
* ng-if, ng-show
* ng-repeat
* ng-class
* ng-click, ng-submit
